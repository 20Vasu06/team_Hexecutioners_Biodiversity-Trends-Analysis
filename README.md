==> Description of Biodiversity Trends


Biodiversity trends analysis involves the study of changes in the variety and abundance of species, ecosystems, and genetic diversity over time. It helps track the health of the natural world, providing insights into the impacts of human activities, climate change, habitat destruction, and conservation efforts. By analyzing trends in biodiversity, scientists can identify species at risk, monitor ecosystem changes, and inform policy decisions to protect and restore natural habitats. This analysis is crucial for understanding the state of biodiversity and guiding global conservation strategies.

==> Tools used

==> Data Source(s)

kaggle

Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)

The World Bank - Environmental Data


==>Execution Steps


Dataset Creation: A dataset is created with data for five species (Asian Elephant, Bengal Tiger, Indian Rhino, Snow Leopard, King Cobra) from 2001 to 2024. Each species has an increasing abundance over time.

Data Inspection: The code checks the first few rows, missing values, and provides basic statistics for the dataset.

Visualizations:

Line Plot: Shows abundance trends for each species over the years.
Count Plot: Displays species distribution across different regions.
Bar Plot: Shows total abundance of all species combined by year.
Box Plot: Visualizes abundance variation by species.
Heatmap: Depicts species abundance over time.
Scatter Plot: Plots abundance vs. year for each species.


Total Abundance: The total abundance of all species is calculated for each year and plotted
